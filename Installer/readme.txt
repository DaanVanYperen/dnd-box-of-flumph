NONSENSICAL PRODUCT WARNING

Box of Flump is a very raw product used for playing around with ideas. 
I use it for a bit of fun. If you want a product that has a solid design 
and clear functionality you should probably look elsewhere.

Last things tested:
- History generation for complete kingdoms. (Whoo!)
- Exporting to OpenDocument format (visit http://www.openoffice.org/ for a means to open the generated files).

Several Open content random lists are used for generating the data. You can find most data in the data\ directory as editable xml files.
